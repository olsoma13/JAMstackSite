## About Me
I've played strategic roles in Enterprise software deployments for the better part of a decade. I'm experienced in Agile and Waterfall deployments as Project Manager, Solution Architect and Product Owner.<br><br> When not saving the world one software deployment at a time, I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter, singing in the National Lutheran Choir, tinkering with various home improvement projects, and brewing beer with my friends.
